        <p> My name is Dejean Whyte. I am 21 years old student of the University of the 
            West Indies and I am currently persuing a major in Computer Science. I am also a
            part time Carry-In Service Techinician for Dell and Website Inventory Manager.
        </p>
        <p> I am interested in Web Development because I find it satisfying to interact with
            attractive and interactive webpages and would like to learn how to create them for others.
